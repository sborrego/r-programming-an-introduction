# R Programming: An Introduction
University of South Florida - Fall Workshop  
Thursday, November 2, 2023  
9:30 - 11:00 am EST  

R is a beginner friendly programming language used for statistical computing and graphics. In this workshop, you will be introduced to the basics of R and begin to explore data analysis. This workshop is one of two R programming lessons and it is recommended to continue on to [Data Analysis and Visualizations with R](https://github.com/sborrego/data-analysis-and-visualization-in-R). Attendees do not need to have any prior programming experience, we will start from the beginning!

## Install R and RStudio or get access on Posit (Formerly RStudio Cloud)

To participate in this workshop you will need to have access to the programming language R and RStudio - see the options below. Please be prepared and have R and RStudio setup using either method before the workshop. If you experience any trouble with installation, please contact me prior to the workshop **staceyborrego@gmail.com**.

### Option 1 - **recommended**

Accessing Rstudio on the cloud is an excellent alternative to installing it on your own computer. You will need to sign up for a free account on their website by following the instructions below. If you already have an accout with the RStudio Cloud, your credentials will still work on the Posit website.

Website: [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)  
- Click **Get Started** 
- Click **Sign Up**
- Provide the necessary information or log in if you have an account with RStudio Cloud
- Under *Your Workspace* on the left side, *Your Content* should be selected
- On the far right, under your name at the top, click on the blue **New Project** button, then **New RStudio Project**
- At the top you can *rename* the project by clicking on Untitled Project  

You are all set! This workspace will be saved and ready to access anytime in the future.

### Option 2

Another option is install all the software on your computer. You will need to install **BOTH** the R programming language and RStudio. If you already have R and RStudio installed, it is recommended to update both. Here is a link to great instructions for all operating systems for both installation and updating: [Installation Instructions](https://preview.carpentries.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#install-r-and-rstudio)
